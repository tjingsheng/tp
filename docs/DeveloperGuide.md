## 4. Design

This section highlight the design considerations for SEPlendid.

### 4.1 Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`SeplendidLogic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`SeplendidModel`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `note delete [1]`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `SeplendidLogic` component defines its API in the `SeplendidLogic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `SeplendidLogicManager.java` class which follows the `SeplendidLogic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

---

### 4.2 UI Component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ItemListPanel`, `ItemDetailPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/seplendidview/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `SeplendidLogic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `SeplendidLogic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `SeplendidLogic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse`, `University`, `Mapping`, and `Note` objects residing in the `Model`.

<br>

---

### 4.3 SeplendidLogic Component

**API** : [`SeplendidLogic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/SeplendidLogic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `SeplendidLogic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `SeplendidLogic` component, taking `execute("note delete [1]")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `NoteDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `SeplendidLogic` component works:

1. When `SeplendidLogic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `SeplendidParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `NoteDeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `NoteDeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `SeplendidLogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `SeplendidModel` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a note).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `SeplendidLogic`.

Here are the other classes in `SeplendidLogic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SeplendidParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `LocalCourseAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `LocalCourseAddCommand`) which the `SeplendidParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `LocalCourseAddCommandParser`, `NoteDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

---

### 4.4 Model Component

**API** : [`SeplendidModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/SeplendidModel.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="100%" />


The `SeplendidModel` component,

* stores the local course, partner course, university, mapping and note data. `SeplendidModelManager` also serves as
  the facade class, for other components to access the data. It stores all the data, which the UI can access to
  display. Commands also take in the `SeplendidModel` object to perform their operations on the data.
* stores the currently 'searched for' `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse`, `University`, `Mapping` objects as separate
  filtered lists, exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<LocalCourse>`, `ObservableList<PartnerCourse>`,
  `ObservableList<University>` and `ObservableList<Mapping>` objects respectively (e.g. the UI can be bound to one of
  these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `SeplendidModel` represents data entities of the domain,
  they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* Local course are represented by `LocalCourse` objects, which are stored in a `UniqueLocalCourseList` object. Each
  `LocalCourse` has `LocalCode`, `LocalName`, `LocalDescription` and `LocalUnit` objects. `PartnerCourse` follows
  similarly, and `Mapping` depends on `LocalCode`, `PartnerCode` and `UniversityName` objects (on top of its own
  `MappingMiscInformation`).
* Information on `Note` model components are omitted in the above diagram for brevity.

<br>

---

### 4.5 Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save local course, partner course, university, mapping, note data and user preference data in JSON format, and
  read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `LocalCourseStorage`, `PartnerCourseCatalogueStorage`, `UniversityCatalogueStorage`,
  `MappingCatalogueStorage`, `NoteCatalogueStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`
  , which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `SeplendidModel` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve
  objects that belong to the `SeplendidModel`).
* `NoteCatalogueStorage` and `UserPrefStorage` are omitted from the above diagram for brevity.

<br>

### 4.6 Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<br>

---

## 5. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<br>

---
### 5.1 Parser to Handle Commands with Optional Arguments

The below diagram gives a high-level overview on how the `SeplendidParser` parses a command from our command set:
<puml src="diagrams/SeplendidParserActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SeplendidParserActivityDiagram" />

<br>

---

### 5.2 List Feature

#### Overview
<br>
The `list` command generates a list of SEPlendid data. The data can be in the for of a `localcourse`, `partnercourse`, 
`university`, `mapping`, or `note`. This allows the viewing of all the data type that is listed.

The activity diagram is as such:
<puml src="diagrams/ListActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

Here is a sequence diagram for `localcourse list`:
<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

<br>
<br>

#### Feature Details

1. The user specifies a data object with its required command word.
2. If invalid command arguments are provided, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an
   error message.
3. If all the above steps are completed without exceptions, then the sample data of the specific data type will be
   displayed.

<br>
<br>

#### Feature Considerations

Each data type has to be specified to ensure organisation of sample data.

<br>

---

### 5.3 Add Feature

**Overview** \
The `add` command allows for the adding of new courses, universities and notes. This allows the creation of new
datatypes.
### 5.3 Add Feature

#### Overview
<br>
The `add` command allows for the adding of `localcourse`, `partnercourse`, `mapping` and `notes`. This allows the 
addition of new data into SEPlendid.

The activity diagram is as such:
<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

<br>

Here is a sequence diagram for `note add`:
<puml src="diagrams/NoteAddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

Here is a sequence diagram for `partnercourse add`:
<puml src="diagrams/PartnercourseAddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

<br>
<br>

#### Feature Details

1. The user is required to fill up all the attributes require to add the data object.
2. If not all the identity attributes are provided, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an
   error message.
3. If the attribute is not applicable for `add`, the user will be prompted to enter the attribute correctly via an
   error message.
4. If there exist the same identifying attributes, SEPlendid will raise an error message to the user.
4. If all the above steps are completed without exceptions, then the data object is successfully queried.

<br>
<br>

**Feature Considerations**

It should be noted that when checking for duplicates in the `UniqueLocalCourseList` and `UniquePartnerCourseList` inside
`SEPlendidModel`, `localcourse` cannot have the same `localcode` and `partnercourse` cannot have the same `partnercode`
and `universityname`. This is because courses have unique course codes and is specific to the university, having this
check would also prevent confusion for users if they have mistakenly added courses that are already in the database.
Furthermore, this would confuse the user on which is the most accurate information available as well.

<br>

---

### 5.4 Delete Feature

#### Overview
The `delete` command deletes specified data object in SEPlendid, specified by their unique identity attributes.

Here is an activity diagram for `delete localcourse`:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteActivityDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteActivityDiagram" />

Here is a sequence diagram for `delete`:
<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteSequenceDiagram" />

#### Feature Details
1. The user specifies a data object with its unique identity attribute(s).
2. If the data object is non-existent, the user will be prompted to enter the identity attributes correctly via an error message.
3. If not all the identity attributes are provided, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
4. If all the above steps complete without any exceptions, then the data object is successfully deleted.

#### Feature Considerations

The data object is only deleted when all the specified identity attributes are identical to an existing data object.

<br>

---

### 5.5 Update Feature
#### Overview
The `update` command updates specified attribute of a data object with updated value.

Here is an activity diagram for `update localcourse`:
<puml src="diagrams/UpdateActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UpdateActivityDiagram" />

Here is a sequence diagram for `update`:
<puml src="diagrams/UpdateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UpdateSequenceDiagram" />

#### Feature Details
1. The user specifies a data object with its unique identity attribute, attribute to be updated, and new value.
2. If the data object is non-existent, the user will be prompted to enter the identity attributes correctly via an error message.
3. If not all the identity attributes are provided, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an error message.
4. If the attribute is not applicable for `update`, the user will be prompted to enter the attribute correctly via an error message.
5. If the updated data object exists in SEPlendid, an error is raised to inform the user.
6. If all the above steps complete without any exceptions, then the data object is successfully updated.

#### Feature Considerations

The data object is only updated when all the specified identity attributes are identical to an existing data object.
Each data type has different attributes that can be used for updating.

<br>

---

### 5.6 Search Feature

#### Overview

The `search` command allows users find specific courses or universities they are interested in. This allows for faster
querying of courses, universities and notes.

The activity diagram is as such:
<puml src="diagrams/SearchActivityDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

Here is a sequence diagram for `partnercourse search`:
<puml src="diagrams/SearchSequenceDiagram.puml" width="100%" />

<br>
<br>

#### Feature Details

1. The user specifies a data object with its unique identity attribute, attribute that they are querying and the
   keyword for the query.
2. If the data object is non-existent, the user will be prompted to enter the identity attributes correctly via an
   error message.
3. If not all the identity attributes are provided, the user will be prompted to enter the command correctly via an
   error message.
4. If the attribute is not applicable for `search`, the user will be prompted to enter the attribute correctly via an
   error message.
5. If all the above steps are completed without exceptions, then the data object is successfully queried.

<br>
<br>

#### Feature Considerations
The data object is only searched when all the specified identity attributes are identical to the existing data object.
Each data type has different attributes that can be used for searching.

<br>

---

### 5.7 Sort Feature
#### Overview
The `sort` command sorts specified data objects by specified attributes.

Here is an activity diagram for `sort localcourse`:
<puml src="diagrams/SortActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SortActivityDiagram" />

Here is an sequence diagram for `sort`:
<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

#### Feature Details
1. The user specifies a data object and its attribute to sort.
2. If the attribute is not applicable for `sort`, the user will be prompted to enter the attribute correctly via an error message.
3. If all the above steps complete without any exceptions, then the data objects will be sorted by specified attribute.

#### Feature Considerations

Each data type has different attributes that can be used for sorting.

<br>

---

### 5.8 Mapping Feature

The mapping `list/add/delete` mechanism is facilitated by `MappingCatalogue`. It stores `Mapping` objects which
contain the `LocalCode`, `UniversityName`, `PartnerCode` and `MappingMiscInformation` objects. This means that
`Mapping` is dependent on `LocalCourse`, `University` and `PartnerCourse` classes (and their respective
`LocalCourseCatalogue`, `UniversityCatalogue` and `PartnerCourseCatalogue`).

A `UniqueMappingList` is stored internally in `MappingCatalogue`, ensuring that Additionally, it implements the
following operations (this list is not exhaustive):

* `MappingCatalogue#addMapping(Mapping)`— Adds a mapping to the mapping catalogue, and throws a
  `DuplicateMappingException` if the mapping already exists based on the primary key (`LocalCode`, `UniversityName`,
  `PartnerCode`).
* `MappingCatalogue#removeMapping(Mapping)`— Removes a mapping from the mapping catalogue, and throws a
  `MappingNotFoundException` if the mapping does not exist.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMapping(Mapping)`— Checks whether a mapping exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to
* prevent duplicate insertion.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMappingWithLocalCode(LocalCode)`— Checks whether a mapping with the specified `LocalCode`
  exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to prevent deleting a `LocalCourse` with such a `LocalCode`.
* `MappingCatalogue#hasMappingWithPartnerCode(PartnerCode)`— Checks whether a mapping with the specified
  `PartnerCode` exists in the mapping catalogue, to use to prevent deleting a `PartnerCourse` with such a `PartnerCode`.

These operations are exposed in the `SeplendidModel` interface as `SeplendidModel#addMapping(Mapping)`,
`SeplendidModel#deleteMapping(Mapping)`, `SeplendidModel#hasMapping(Mapping)`, `SeplendidModel#hasMapping(LocalCode,
UniversityName, PartnerCode)`,`SeplendidModel#hasMappingWithLocalCode(LocalCode)` and
`SeplendidModel#hasMappingWithPartnerCode(PartnerCode)` respectively.

When the user launches the application for the first time. All relevant data catalogues: `LocalCourseCatalogue`,
`PartnerCourseCatalogue`, `UniversityCatalogue`, `MappingCatalogue` are initialized with the initial state, containing
the seed data for that year's SEP.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addMapping` mechanism works.

<puml src="diagrams/MappingAddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MappingAddSequenceDiagram" />

Before a mapping is added, the `MappingAddCommand` object will access the `SeplendidModel` instance to check if the
respective `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse` and `University` exists. If any of them does not exist, the command will
not execute `SeplendidModel#addMapping`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, no `CommandResult` will be returned, and hence no update to the UI or
storage files.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `MappingAddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, the `MappingDeleteCommand` object will access the `SeplendidModel` instance to check if the mapping
exists, before deletion. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `deleteMapping` mechanism works.

<puml src="diagrams/MappingDeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MappingDeleteSequenceDiagram" />

`MappingDeleteCommand` will call `SeplendidModel#getMessageIfExists` which returns an `Optional<Mapping>`. If it is
non-empty, the deletion will be performed, otherwise a `CommandException` will be thrown.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How the dependency of `Mapping` on `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse` and `University` should be managed:**

* **Alternative 1 (implemented choice):** Disallow deletion of a `LocalCourse` or `PartnerCourse` if it exists in a
  mapping.
    * Note that `Unviersity` entries cannot be deleted as partner universities are fixed for every SEP application
      window.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, prevents accidental deletion.
    * Cons: May have to delete a large number of mappings to remove a course (no force deletion feature).

* **Alternative 2:** Deleting a `LocalCourse` or `PartnerCourse` will delete all its associated mappings.
    * Pros: Will use fewer actions to delete a course, if there exists mappings it is tied to.
    * Cons: We must ensure that deletion cascades, in order to maintain data integrity. This can introduce bugs if not
      done correctly.

<br>

---

### 7.1 Product Scope

**Target user profile**:

This product is for NUS Computing students who are applying for Student Exchange Programme (SEP), who prefer a
faster and more versatile tool to access SEP-related information, compared to the current EduRec system. Seniors who
had underwent the exchange program, or students who learn about courses through their research can also contribute
course mappings.

The following further describes our target users:

* has a need to view course mappings offered by partner universities
* is keen to contribute course mappings
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition:** \
SEPlendid aims to provide an advanced search, allowing users to search for mappings by various attributes such
as partner universities' course names, and NUS course codes. We aim to also include features such as the ability to
contribute course mappings, and note-taking.

### 8.7 Saving Data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

- If any of the `.json` files found under the `data/` directory created is edited to have invalid data. SEPlendid
  will reset to the default data, which has been programmatically added.
- Therefore, it is recommended to make a copy and keep a backup of existing data before making any changes to any of
  the files under `data/*.json`.
- One corrupted file will lead to a full reset of the application.

2. To simulate a missing/corrupted data file, delete the `data/` directory.

- A new director will be created in its place, with the default seed data.
- To corrupt the data, open any of the `.json` files under `data/` and edit the data in it. For instance, you may
  change a `localCode` to the empty string `""`. Restart the application, and observe that the data has been reset.

## 9. Planned enhancements

This section describes the planned enhancements for SEPlendid.

- [ ] Add the ability to allow update of mappings, to complement the existing mapping feature. This was not prioritised
  due to time constraints.
- [ ] Add memory for resizing of windows. The application should remember the window size from the latest run.

## 10. Effort

The implementation of SEPlendid proved to be a challenging endeavor. Below is the highlights of the extensive effort our
team dedicated to developing SEPlendid, along with a mention of some of the challenges we encountered along the way.

### 10.1 Morphing of AB3 to SEPlendid


As mappings was the core feature of SEPlendid, we decided to morph AB3 into SEPlendid. We identified the need for
several data types, minimally `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse`, `University` and `Mapping`. We also identified the
unique identifiers for each data type, and the relationships between them. For instance, a `Mapping` object has a
`LocalCode`, `PartnerCode` and `UniversityName` object. `LocalCode` is the unique identifier (or in database terms,
the primary key) of `LocalCourse`, and {`PartnerCode`, `UniversityName`} is the unique identifier of `PartnerCourse`.
As the `Mapping` object is dependent on `LocalCourse`, `PartnerCourse` and `University`, we decided to decouple
these data storages, to avoid data redundancy and inconsistency. Initially, AB3 only offered 1 data storage, which
is the address book and this led us to refactor a large portion of the codebase to accommodate the new data types.
A new parser implementation was also required to handle the new command format.

One challenge we encountered was the need to access model for other data, such as `LocalName` of `LocalCourse`,
which is not part of the unique identifier, for the purpose of searching and sorting. `Mapping` did not consist of a
`LocalName` object, as it would lead to data redundancy. This challenge was solved with passing only the method
reference of a model method `getLocalCourseIfExists` to the comparators and predicates used. This follows for
partner courses.

A large portion of code had to be refactored to morph AB3 to SEPlendid.

### 10.2 Redesigning the UI

In recognising the significance of minimalism for achieving simplicity, we embarked on the task of redesigning the
original AB3 UI into our custom SEPlendid interface. The endeavor underscored the essential balance between simplicity
and functionality. The effort invested in the redesigning process was substantial, requiring meticulous design
considerations. Striving to meet both aesthetic standards and high functionality, we faced a steep learning curve with
JavaFX. Despite the initial challenges, our team persevered, overcoming obstacles and ultimately producing a UI that not
only met our design goals but also offered a visually appealing and highly functional experience tailored to the
requirements of a student exchange program mapping tool.

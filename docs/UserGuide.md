**Extra Notes on our Command Format:**

* The command format is `command-word action-word [parameters]`. <br /> `action-word`s include `sort`, `search`, `add`,
  `delete`, `update`, `tag`, but not all `action-word`s can be used after each `command-word`. 
* Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary)for a quick overview of which `action-word`s can follow a `command-word`.

* `[parameters]` refer to any number of parameters which can follow an `action-word`. For instance, for the
  `localcourse delete` command, the full format is `localcourse delete [localcode]`, which signifies that we
  have a parameter (`localcode`) to fill. <br />

  An invocation of the command is exemplified by:
  > `localcourse delete [localcode]`.

* The following characters do not exist in our datasets and are not accepted in our input: `[` and `]`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.


### 4.3 Try Out Your first command

In order to get you started with SEPlendid's commands, we should try out a command together!

Let's start with the most basic command `add` command. `add` command allows you to add a local, partner course or note.

One of the available commands for `add` is the command to add a localcourse into your storage.


**Format:** `localcourse add [localcode] [localname] [unit] [localdescription]`

The first word of each command specifies the different core features with its own unique sets of functionalities.
- `localcourse` tells SEPlendid that this command word would execute actions only for local courses
- Attributes such as `localcode` and `localname` shows you what you should place in each portion of the command

<box type="tip" icon=":bulb:" >
    <b>Tip:</b> All the attributes for local course needs to be added.
</box>

Let's imagine this scenario, there is a newly offered course by NUS Computing, CS2105. Interested with this course, you 
want to add this localcourse in SEPlendid.

<br/> 

**So how can you add CS2105 to SEPlendid?**

Firstly, you would need to input this command: \
`localcourse add [CS2105] [Introduction to Computer Networks] [4.0] [Web and Web applications]`

Secondly, you would need to take note of the parameters that are required to be added:
- `localcode`: CS2105
- `localname`: Introduction to Computer Networks
- `localunit`: 4.0 
- `localdescription`: Web and Web applications

Lastly, you should take note of invalid formats:
- `localcourse add [CS2105]`
  The attributes such as local name and units are compulsory.
- `localcourse add CS2105 Introduction to Computer Networks 4.0`
  The brackets ("[ ]") wrapping each attribute is compulsory.
- `localcourse add`
  There is insufficient information on what local course to add.

<br>

<question type="checkbox">

##### Have you conducted these checks before executing commands in SEPlendid?

  <br>
  <q-option correct>
    I know the datatype that would like to query e.g. local course, partner course, university.
  </q-option>
  <q-option correct>
    I know the required parameters for each command.
  </q-option>
  <q-option correct>
    I know "[ ]" are compulsory for wrapping each attribute.
  </q-option>
</question>

Conducting these checks would prevent error messages and result in more efficient querying of results!

Now, you are equipped with the basics to start using SEPlendid!

<br>
<br>

### Project: SEPlendid

**SEPlendid** is a versatile application used by prospective exchangers to plan their Student Exchange Programme (SEP)
study plans. Students from NUS Computing can use this CLI-based application, with a beautiful GUI, to view partner
universities and course mappings. The application is also bundled with many other useful features.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* * **New Feature**: Added the ability to search for localcourses, partnercourses and universities. [#156,#105](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/pull/156)
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to query for courses and universities they are interested in.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may wish to find the course or 
    university they are interested in. The app will narrow down the search and allow for more easy retrieving and
    viewing of the results.

* * **New Feature**: Added the ability to update for localcourses [#195](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/pull/195)
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to sort localcourses by its attributes - localcode and localname.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user will be able to view the courses in order, 
    organising the large number of sample data.

* * **New Feature**: Added the ability to list universities [#79](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/pull/79)
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to retrieve all the information of universities.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to view all the universities offered by NUS Computing, allowing them to 
    choose and research on the universities they are interested in.
